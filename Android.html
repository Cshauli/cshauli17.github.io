<h1> Android Project </h1>
<p> This is our Android project. We created a version of Jeopardy where the goal is to get the answers correct and each dollar amount gets higher as it is worth more. We were able to complete the base version but still want to add a few things in the future. Something we would like to add would be a scoring system using the Tinydb tool. For now, we created a tool that tells you whether or not your answer is correct or not.</p>

This is a picture of our game's home screen where you pick which category and question you would like!

<p> This piece of code is showing the process that our app uses to decide whether the answer is correct or not. It will then send the data to start a timer that will later go back to the home screen to pick a new question!
