		<title> Geek Batle Board game</title>
	</head>
	<p> Welcome to our Python Project! Our game is called "Geek Battle." The idea of the game is to answer 21 questions, True or False(t or f on the keyboard)</p>
	<p> I think that we did a really good job making this project, even though we did have a few struggles. We are still currently working on a bug and hope to have that fixed soon. We really would have liked to have a bit more time in order to integrate more questions and maybe turn them into multiple choice. -- CP Shaulis</p>
